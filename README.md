##This project implements a basic Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm in C to demonstrate a simple and efficient form of data compression. The program allows the user to either compress or decompress text files via a menu-based terminal interface. In compression mode, it scans repeating characters in the input file and stores them as a single character with a count (e.g., aaa becomes 3a). In decompression mode, it reverses the process to restore the original content. The tool was developed using standard C libraries and compiled using GCC in VS Code. This task provides a hands-on understanding of how simple compression techniques work and highlights the importance of file size optimization in software systems.
